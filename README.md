# ViSatGui

ViSatGui is a prototype interface for an unpowered gliding aerial monitoring satellite. This project is developed using the QT Framework, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize and interact with satellite data.

## Features

- **Aerial Monitoring**: Simulates the interface of a satellite monitoring system.
- **Graphical Visualization**: Uses the QCustomPlot library for real-time data plotting and visualization.
- **Cross-Platform**: Developed using C++ and QT, making it compatible with multiple operating systems.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/godofecht/ViSatGui.git
   ```
2. Open the project in QT Creator.
3. Build and run the project within the IDE.

## Usage

After running the application, use the provided GUI to interact with satellite data. The interface supports various visualization tools for monitoring and analyzing the satellite's path and other metrics.

## Dependencies

- **QT Framework**: Ensure that you have the QT environment installed.
- **QCustomPlot**: Used for plotting the graphs within the GUI.
